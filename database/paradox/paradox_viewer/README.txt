This demo programs requires the package LazParadoxPkg (available via OPM, or
on https://sourceforge.net/p/lazarus-ccr/svn/HEAD/tree/components/tparadoxdataset/).

Since the TParadoxDataset component is created at runtime here, it is not
required to install the package - just opening it in the package editor for
one time is enough so that the IDE knows where the package is.
